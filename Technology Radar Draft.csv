Backstage,Assess,platforms-and-services,TRUE,"<p>In an increasingly digital world, improving developer effectiveness in large organizations is often a core concern of senior leaders. Backstage is an open-source developer portal platform created by Spotify that improves discovery of software assets across the organization. It uses Markdown <a href=""https://backstage.io/docs/features/techdocs/techdocs-overview"">TechDocs</a> that live alongside the code for each service, which nicely balances the needs of centralized discovery with the need for distributed ownership of assets. Backstage supports software templates to accelerate new development and a plugin architecture that allows for extensibility and adaptability into an organization's infrastructure ecosystem. <a href=""https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog/software-catalog-overview"">Backstage Service Catalog</a> uses YAML files to track ownership and metadata for all the software in an organization's ecosystem; it even lets you track third-party SaaS software, which usually requires tracking ownership.</p>"

Online services for formatting or parsing code,Hold,platforms-and-services,TRUE,"We want to highlight a common practice that needs to be approached with care or even stopped entirely: <strong>online services for formatting or parsing code</strong>. There are many useful sites for formatting or parsing formats such as JSON and YAML, as well as sites that assess code tutorials or produce online code metrics. Great care is needed when using these. Pasting a block of JavaScript, JSON or similar into an unknown website can easily create security and privacy issues and might unknowingly export personal data into a different jurisdiction. These sites should never be used with production data and should be approached with caution in all other circumstances.</p>"
